* _Version_: 5.2.9 and probably previous versions
* _CVE_: CVE-2018-18519

## Description ##

BestXsoftware Best Free Keylogger 5.2.9 allows local users to gain privileges via
a Trojan horse `%PROGRAMFILES%\BFK 5.2.9\syscrb.exe` file because of insecure
permissions for the BUILTIN\Users group.

## Attack Vectors ##

Best Free Keylogger v. 5.2.9 is installed on the system.

The attacker (with arbitrary privileges) replaces the file `C:\Program Files\BFK 5.2.9\syscrb.exe`.
It is world writable (Windows Group: Users).

A victim user opens a session, such as through a RDP client, and
`C:\Program Files\BFK 5.2.9\syscrb.exe` is executed with the logged-in user's privileges.

The attacker can execute arbitrary code impersonating the victim.
